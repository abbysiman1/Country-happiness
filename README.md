# Country-happiness
Machine Learning Project on predicting country happiness 
In a world facing numerous global challenges such as economic inequality, climate change, and social unrest, understanding the specific factors that contribute to a country's overall happiness and citizen well-being is vital. Identifying these factors can empower policymakers and communities to make informed decisions that foster a higher quality of life.

Happiness goes beyond our individual feelings; it significantly influences health, productivity, relationships, and more. When citizens are happier, they are more engaged, productive, and supportive of their communities. By pinpointing the most influential factors of happiness, societies can effectively address disparities, prioritize resources, and implement policies that enhance well-being for all.

Our project will analyze various features, including economic, social, and environmental factors, across six different countries. Using data collection and machine learning algorithms, we will assess how these factors contribute to the overall happiness levels for each country. Our goal is to create a model with a high accuracy rate to predict overall happiness for six different countries.
